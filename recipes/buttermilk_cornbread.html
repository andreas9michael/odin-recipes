    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The best cornbread recipe is my grandmother's, and this is it—sweet and moist!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 cup cornmeal</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan.</li>

        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in sugar. Quickly whisk in eggs.</li>

        <li>Combine buttermilk and baking soda in a small bowl; whisk mixture into the skillet. Stir in cornmeal, flour, and salt until well-blended and only a few lumps remain. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>

        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion to the hot oil and cook until onions begin to get tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
